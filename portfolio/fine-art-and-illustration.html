<h1>Fine Art & Illustration</h1>
<hr />

<p>Iâ€™ve had a love for art ever since childhood. Though I have enjoyed working in several mediums, watercolor has been 
  and to this day remains my favorite. With another life-long love of mine for reading, the application of art to the 
  written word through illustration has been a natural transition.</p>


<div class="galleries">
  {% for image in site.data.galleries.art %}
    <div class="gallery-container">
      <div>
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/{{ image.html }}">
        <img alt="{{ image.alt }}"
            src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/portfolio/{{ image.gallery }}/{{ image.image }}">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>{{ image.title }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
  <div class="clearfix"></div>
</div>
