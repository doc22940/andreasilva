<h1>Fine Art & Illustration</h1>
<hr />

<p>Iâ€™ve had a love for art ever since childhood. Though I have enjoyed working in several mediums, watercolor has been 
  and to this day remains my favorite. With another life-long love of mine for reading, the application of art to the 
  written word through illustration has been a natural transition.</p>

        data-image="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/portfolio/art/{{ image.full }}"
        data-description="{{ image.description }}"
