<h1>Scenes From Literature</h1>
<hr />

<p>Iâ€™ve had a love for art ever since childhood. Though I have enjoyed working in several mediums, watercolor has been 
  and to this day remains my favorite. With another life-long love of mine for reading, the application of art to the 
  written word through illustration has been a natural transition.</p>
