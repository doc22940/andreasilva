<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />

<p>Hi! My name is Andrea Silva. I’m a native Kansan who just recently moved to Texas…more specifically the Rio Grande Valley. 
I’ve loved art as long as I can remember and pursued that love of art in college where I studied Graphic Design with minors 
in Painting and Music. I graduated from Tabor College in Hillsboro, KS in 2010.</p>

<p>While in college I worked part-time at KJIL, a Christian radio station in Abilene, KS, and soon discovered a love for radio 
  as well, which led to my accepting a full-time position there after graduating. I was able to work as their graphic designer 
  in house for 8 years and I continue on in that role remotely. Currently I also work in graphic design at KVMV, a Christian 
  radio station in McAllen, TX.</p>

<p>In June of 2016 I married Esau, the love of my life, and I am enjoying being a newlywed! Hobbies I pursue include anything 
  crafty, from creating and sewing costumes, to shaping, cutting, and trimming the perfect decorative pie top. I love travel 
  and exploration, experiencing new things like the many exotic fruits the Rio Grande Valley has to offer, relaxing with a good 
  book, or going for a bike ride.</p>

<p>Though I love being an artist and graphic designer, my true identity lies in my relationship with Jesus Christ and learning 
  to follow Him. Any skills I possess, I realize come from Him alone.</p> 

<p>Thanks for taking the time to stop by my website!</p>
